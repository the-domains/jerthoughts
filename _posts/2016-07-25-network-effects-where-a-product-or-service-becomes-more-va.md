  Network effects — where a product or service becomes more valuable to its
  users as more people use it — areoneof the key ways software businesses
  maintain a better product and more defensible market position. This is
  especially true of messaging apps like WeChat — which, as I’vearguedbefore, is
  not just a messaging app but is actually more of a portal, a platform, and a
  mobile operating system. However you label it, WeChat is an entire ecosystem
  in and of itself, especially as it’s used in Asia. This is largely enabled by
  the sheer amount of payments credentials attached to user accounts, which
  significantly reduces friction in transacting across the marketplace, both
  online and offline.

Network effects --- where a product or service becomes more valuable to its users as more people use it --- are[one][0]of the key ways software businesses maintain a better product and more defensible market position. This is especially true of messaging apps like WeChat --- which, as I've[argued][1]before, is not just a messaging app but is actually more of a portal, a platform, and a mobile operating system. However you label it, WeChat is an entire ecosystem in and of itself, especially as it's used in Asia. This is largely enabled by the sheer amount of payments credentials attached to user accounts, which significantly reduces friction in transacting across the marketplace, both online and offline.

But how did WeChat resolve their "chicken-egg problem" --- getting more users or more merchants on both sides of the marketplace without there being critical mass on either side at first? For getting the user side, it is no easier to type in your payment credentials into a messaging platform (for the first time) than it is to type it into a third-party merchant form to complete a transaction --- no time is saved, no friction is removed. Similarly, for the merchant side of the marketplace, there is no incentive to dedicate marketing dollars and engineering resources to the platform in the first place if there's not already an existing base of purchase-ready users. Unless you're Apple with its credit-card ready iTunes, most messaging and other app platforms must work extra hard to get users to willingly share payment credentials. They have to convince the user that either he/she will soon purchase again on the platform, or that there is some other immediate benefit to setting up a[digital wallet][2]with them. Users have no incentive to do so otherwise.
